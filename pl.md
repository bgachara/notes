# Understanding Programming Languages

## Properties of PL.

1. Syntax.
2. Names.
3. Types.
4. Semantics.


-Increased ability to express ideas
-Improved background for choosing appropriate languages
-Increased ability to learn new languages
-Better understanding of significance of implementation
-Better use of languages that are already known
-Overall advancement of computing

## Language Features.

1. Garbage Collection
2. First-class functions.
3. Static type-checking.
4. Parametric Polymorphism
5. Immutable programming
6. Automatic type inference.
7. Algebraic data types.
8. Pattern matching.
9. Language Syntax.
10. Performance
11. Explicit memory management

- Type Errors. / accessing memory not allocated to the program. /
- Types and Optimizations.
- Type safety and Type checking.
/ type casting, pointer arihtmetic, explicit deallocation and dangling pointers /
- Compile time checking, before the program starts.
- Run time checking, after the program has started.
- Type checker.
- Type Inference.
/ buffer overflows, out-of-bound array access, dangling pointers.

*What is the standard library of a language*
*How do you know when a programming language is taking advantage of modern HPC*
*What and How important are programming paradigms*
*Regular vs Context-free languages*
*Clear understanding of Static Analysis*
*Cost of runtime safety checks and garbage collection*


- Control Structures.
    - Direct sequencing.
    - Conditional branching.
- Iterations.
    - Bounded Iterations.
    - Conditional / Unbounded Iterations.
- Subroutines / Procedures.
- 

## Tools

- Antlr - ANother Tool for Language Recognition.
    - Parser that automates the construction of language recognizers.


## Domain Specific Languages.

- Internal Dsl and External Dsl.
- *identify areas ready for dsl application i.e sql,html,audio,js,*

## PL Error Types/Faults

- Buffer Overflows.
- Out-of-bounds array access.
- Dangling pointers.

## Taxonomy of safety violations

- Memory Access Errors.
    - Spatial Access Errors.
    - Temporal Access Errors.
- Type cast Errors.
- Memory Leak Errors - fail to release all the memory they allocate.
