## Introduction

- Desired outcomes
  - Pure (mathematical) functions
  - Immutable Data
  - No/Less side-effects
  - Declarative
  - Easier to verify
  - Lazy evaluated
  - Abstract Data Types

### Function definition

- name arg1, arg2, arg3 ... = <exp>
- functions have types
- let and where bindings...lazy evaluated
- can write functions in infix notation style

### Recursion

- there are no while and for loops, use recursion
- can use Guards in place of if...then

### Pattern matching

### Accumulators

### Lists and Tuples

- lists should be of the same type.
  - lists functions
- list comprehension
- tuple types don't have to be the same.

### Higher Order functions and Anonymous functions

- Map 
- functions that take in other functions as arguments.
- partial function application and currying
- function composition
