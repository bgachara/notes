# Data Structures and Algorithms

`Any problem in computer science can be solved using indirection`

## Design and Analysis of Algorithms.

- Algorithm design techniques.
- Classification of algorithm around design ideas.
- Utility in general problem solving techniques. 

## Fundamentals of Algorithmic Problem Solving

- Understanding the problem.
- 

## Computational Thinking

- Decomposition - break problem down into subproblems.
- Pattern Recognition - notice similarities, differences, properties or trends in data.
- Pattern Generalization - define a concept or idea in general terms via doing away with the unnecessary. Abstraction.
- Algorithm design - repeatable, step-by-step process to solve a particular problem.
