# Data Structures and Algorithms

`Any problem in computer science can be solved using indirection`

## Introduction

- Algorithms are well-defined procedures for solving problems.
- Reason for using DSA
  - Efficiency
  - Abstraction
  - Reusability


## General approaches in Algo Design

- Randomized algorithms
  - rely on the statistical properties of random numbers.
- Divide and conquer algorithms
  - rely on divide, conquer and combine.
- Dynamic programming solutions
  - subproblems are not independent of one another.
- Greedy algorithms
  - make decisions that look best at the moment, locally optimal in the hope that they will lead to globally optimal solutions.
- Approximation algorithms
  - do not compute optimal solutions, just solutions that are good enough, computationally expensive problems


## Design and Analysis of Algorithms.

- Algorithm design techniques.
- Classification of algorithm around design ideas.
- Utility in general problem solving techniques. 

## Fundamentals of Algorithmic Problem Solving

- Understanding the problem.
- 

## Computational Thinking

- Decomposition - break problem down into subproblems.
- Pattern Recognition - notice similarities, differences, properties or trends in data.
- Pattern Generalization - define a concept or idea in general terms via doing away with the unnecessary. Abstraction.
- Algorithm design - repeatable, step-by-step process to solve a particular problem.

> A procedure that  has all the characteristics  of an algorithm except that it possibly lacks finiteness may be called a computational method.

## Important features

- Finiteness - algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps.
- Definiteness - Each step must be precisely defined, actions must be rigorously and unambiguously specified for each case. Programming languages used to achieve this.
- Input - has zero or more inputs. Given as algo begins or dynamically as it runs.
- Outputs - zero or more quantities that have a relation to the inputs.
- Effectiveness - operations must be sufficiently basic

### Algorithmic Analysis

- Length of time taken to perform the algorithm.
- Adaptability of algorithm to different kind of computers.
- Quantitative behaviour of algorithms.
- 

## Misc

- Sometimes we find that many questions have a similar structure and are instances of the same problem.
