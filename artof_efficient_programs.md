# Art of Efficient Programs

`notes from the book by the same name`

## Performance Fundamentals

- methodology for studying the performance of programs, based on measurements, benchmarking, profiling.
- need for understanding intracacies between processor and memory architecture.

### What is Performance?

- Efficiency vs Performance
- Efficiency deals with using resources optimally and not wasting them.
- An efficient program makes good use of computational hardware, doesn't leave resources idle:processor, memory, network.
- Speed - Throughput - amount of computations the program does in a given time.
- Performance: throughput, power consumption, real-time apps, context dependent
- Evaluating, estimating and predicting performance.
- Performance considerations and targets have their place at the design stage jsut like other design goals.
- Do not optimize prematurely and don't pessimize intentionally either.

### Learning list for high-perfomance programs

- Choosing the right algorithm.
- Using the CPU resources effectively.
- Using memory effectively.
- Avoiding unnecessary computations
- Use concurrency and multi-threading effectively.
- Using the programming language effectively.
- Measuring performance and interpreting results.
