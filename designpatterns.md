# Design Patterns

## Object-Oriented Patterns

- Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment and then describes the core of the solution to that problem in such a way that you can use this solution a million times
  over without ever doing it the same way twice.
- Solutions expressed in objects and interfaces.
- Pattern elements
  - Pattern name
  - Problem
  - Solution
  - Consequences

## Functional Patterns

- Using expressions rather than statements lets us eliminate unneeded variables
