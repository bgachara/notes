# FFMPEG


## Introduction

  - Acronym for Fast Forward Motion Picture Expert Group.
  - platform or structure for developing software applications.
  - able to process anything in terms of audio, video, data and pictures.
  - Encode - process of compressing a file so as to enable the faster transmission of the file.
  - Decode - function that translates encoded data into its original format.
  - Codec
    - enCOder, DECoder.
    - video codecs - MPEG, H.264, AV1
    - audio codecs - Mp3, AAC, Opus, ogg, vorbis, flac, alac
  - Bitrate 
    - data rate, is the amount of data per second in the encoded video file, usually expressed in kilobits per secod(kps) or megabits per second(mbps)
    - mp3 - maximum bitrate of 320 kilobit per second.
    - standard CD - 1.411 kilobit per second
    - h264 video in FullHd has a bitrate in the range of 3.000 - 6.000kbps, while 4k can reach 51.000 kbps
    - non-compressed i.e Apple ProRes format in 4k can reach 253,900kbps.
  - Container
    - like a box contains important objects, containers exist to allow multiple data streams such as video, audio, subtitles and other data, to be embedded into a single file.
    - e.g mp4, mkv, webm, mov, mxf, asf, MPEG transfrom stream(.ts), Core Audio Format(.caf), webp
  - Mux
    - process of taking encoded data in the form of packets and write it into files in a specific container format
  - Demux
    - process of reading media files and split it into chunks of data.
  - Transmuxing
    - repackaging, packetizing
    - process in which audio and video files are repackaged into different delivery formats without changing original file content.
  - Transcoding
    - process of converting a media file or object from one format to another.
  - Resolution
    - defines the number of pixels that make up the picture on your screen.
    - TV resolution is defined as number of pixels contained vertically in the picture.
    - SD -480, HD - 720,1080, UHD - 2160, 4320 - 8K UHD.
  - Aspect Ratio
    - is the ratio of width to height of the TV screen.
    - certain spect ratios are designed to handle certain resolutions without stretching or distortion of picture without blank space around the picture.
    - 4:3, 16:9
  - Interlaced format
    - display a full picture by dividing it into 2 different set of lines: the even and the odd lines.
    - each are displayed on the screen every 1/60th of a second, both of which constitute a video frame.
    - earliest video compression method.
  - Progressive
    - displays both even and odd lines at the same time, entire video frame at the same time.
  - Letter box
    - is the practice of transferring film shot in a widescreen aspect ratio to standard width video formats while preserving the content original aspect ratio.
    - LBX, LTBX
  - VOD/SVOD
    - video on demand
    - Subscription video on demand
  - Streaming
    - process of delivering media through small chunks of compressed data and sent to a requesting device.
  - HLS
    - HTTP Live Streaming Protocol.
    - created by Apple for delivering video destined for Apple devices.
  - DASH
    - Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over Http
    - Open source HLS
  - M3U8
    - standard text file encoded utf-8 format and organized as a playlist of items  with their location, to be reproduced in a particular sequence.
  - AV1
    - AOMedia - Alliance for Open Media Video 1
    - Ms, Amazon, Apple, Mozilla, Netflix, Google,Intel
  - HDR
    - High Dynamic Range
    - Recreate image realism from camera through post-production to display and distribution.
  - h264
    - standard for video compression defined by MPEG AND ITU.
    - h264/AVC
