# Jara Programming Language Design Sheet.

`This is my guiding design specification for the Jara programming language.`

## Notes to keep in mind

- Prioritise a functional programming paradigm language.
    - Scalars.
    - Algebraic data types.
    - First-class functions.
    - Recursion.
        

## Design goals

- A well defined syntactic and semantic description of the programming language
- Determinism of program structure
- Fast translation
- High efficiency
- Reliability
- Machine Independent
- Generality
- Extensibility
- Provability
- Consistency with common notations
