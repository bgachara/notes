- The support role is on both sides, support the users of the software product as per their/organisation needs and also support the product engineers interface with the users by providing them with actionable points on the use.
- Always touch base on how a particular problem was solved and document if possible to aid in the iteration/ reoccurence of the problem.
- Always reproduce the error with the system user whenever possible to get an idea of how they did it.
