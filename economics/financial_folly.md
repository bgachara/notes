`Notes from This Time its different - Eight Centuries of Financial Folly`

## Introduction

- No matter how different the latest financial frenzy or crisis always appears, there are usually remarkable similarities with past experiences
  from other countries and from history.
- Recognise these analogies and precedents.
- Common theme:
  - Excessive debt accumulation , whether it be government, banks, corporations or consumers often poses systemic risks than it seems during a boom.
  - Infusions of cash can make a government look like it is providing greater growth to its economy than it really is.
  - Private sector borrowing can inflate housing and stock prices far beyond their long-run sustainable levels.
  - Such lasrge-scale debt build-ups pose risks because they make an economy vulnerable to crisis of confidence, esp when debt is short term and needs to be
    constantly refinanced.
  - Debt fueled booms all too often provide false affirmation of a government policies,a financial institutions ability to make outsized profits or 
    country's standards of living.
  - Balalncing the risk and opportunities of debt is always a challenge.
